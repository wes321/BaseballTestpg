<h1>Baseball</h1>

<p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.<image id= float right, img src="baseball.jpg"></p>

<p>The <b>batting team</b> attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running <b>counter-clockwise</b> around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate. 

<p>Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid 19 centry, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area.[17] By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game."[18] A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1858 in Corona, Queens New York, at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place.</p>
